# Getting Started with Reliant

Reliant is a browser extension that makes it easier to defend in military gameplay. This guide will walk you through the installation, setup, and usage of Reliant.

## Installation

1. Download the `.zip` file from [here](https://github.com/libcord-tech/reliant-dev/releases/latest/download/reliant-release.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file and move the extracted folder to a convenient location on your computer.
3. Open Google Chrome and click on the three dots icon in the top-right corner of the browser window.
4. From the dropdown menu, select "More tools" and then click on "Extensions".
5. On the Extensions page, enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
6. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder that you extracted in step 2.

## Setup

1. After installing Reliant, you should see three new buttons at the top of templated NationStates pages. Click on the "Reliant Settings" button.
2. On the settings page, go through each setting and configure them according to your preferences. Make sure to set your "Main Nation" at the top, as it is the most important setting. If you have any questions about what a specific setting does, please refer to the documentation or ask for assistance.
    - **Important:** Please do not use the "counter thorn" feature at the moment, as it may not work as expected.

## Prepping

1. If you want to use the quick and mindless prepping feature, ensure that your password and switcher list are properly set on the settings page.
2. Log into the first nation (or whichever nation you want to start prepping from) in your switcher set. For convenience, there are login links at the bottom of the Settings page.
3. Click the "Prep" button at the top of the page or press your designated Prep key.
4. On the new page, click the "Update" button.
5. Keep pressing your Prep key until all switchers have been prepped. This process logs in, moves nations, applies to the World Assembly (WA), and clears the dossier of all your switchers. You can track the progress by monitoring the "switchers prepped" number in the top-left corner.

## Loading Applications

### Gmail

1. If you are using Gmail, load the WA applications into Reliant by clicking on your first WA email.
2. Repeatedly click the "next email" button until all applications have been loaded.
3. To confirm that the applications were successfully loaded (ideally before you have gone through all of them), press your Main Page key. The number in the top-left corner indicates the number of successfully loaded switchers.

### Non-Gmail

1. To load an application, open the page for that specific application, then proceed to the next email. Please note that this process can be tedious, so using Gmail is recommended for a smoother experience.

## Chasing

1. Press your "Main Page Key".
2. Set the raider jump point on the right side of the page.
3. Click the "Admit on Next Switcher" button. Alternatively, if you already have a nation in the WA, log in to that nation and click the "Update" button.
4. Press the "Endorse" key. Keep pressing it until you have endorsed as many nations as possible. Similar to the standard ajax2 page, only recent admits will be visible.
5. Press the "Dossier" key. Keep pressing it until you have dossiered as many nations as possible. Again, only recent admits will be visible, just like on the standard ajax2 page.
6. Repeatedly press your "Move" key until you have moved to a region. Unlike Breeze, you can press any key as quickly as you want without having to pace yourself. The Move key will both refresh your reports page and move your nation to the region.
7. After moving to a region, press your "Refresh" key to check if the region has updated (the current region will be displayed under "Current Region").
8. If you need to move back to the jump point region (e.g., "The South Pacific"), use the "Move back to Jump Point" key. You might need to press it 2-3 times.
9. When you need to switch nations, double-tap your "Resign" key to both resign and admit on your next switcher.

By following this process, you should only need to keep the Main Page open while chasing, without requiring any other pages.

## Detagging

1. Move to the target region.
2. Press your Move key again.
3. Keep pressing your Endorse key until you have endorsed everyone in the region.
4. Keep pressing your Move key. This will complete the entire process, including checking if the region has updated, checking if you have become the delegate, appointing yourself as the Regional Officer (RO), dismissing existing ROs, and switching to the next nation.

Please note that the detagging process can be error-prone, so it is not recommended to use it unless there is a fast detag run.
